# Directional Exhaustion After Forced Flow — Phase-1 Interpretation Lock

> Is there a consistent asymmetry between continuation vs reversal hazard after forced flow exhaustion, with no sign flips and stable early hazard shape?

**NO.**

Directional exhaustion after forced flow is **FAILED Phase-1** and is **permanently frozen** for this run. Move on to the next microstructure candidate.
