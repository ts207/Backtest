# Cross-Venue Lead-Lag / Desynchronization — Phase-1 Interpretation Lock

> Is there a consistent asymmetry between continuation vs reversal hazard after cross-venue desync, with no sign flips and stable early hazard shape?

**NO.**

No spot features were available in the baseline run, so events/controls were empty and hazards/stability tables were not populated. Cross-venue desync is **FAILED Phase-1** and is **permanently frozen** for this run.
