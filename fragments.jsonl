Derive microstructure features such as spreads, depth, volume buckets, realized volatility, liquidation count, OI changes, etc.\n\nEvent registry – A versioned database that defines event types (funding dislocation, basis dislocation, liquidation cascade, volatility shock, liquidity shock, structural break, regime shift, microstructure imbalance shock). Each event type has deterministic triggers expressed as functions of PIT features (e.g., funding dislocation when premium index + interest exceeds a threshold; order‑book imbalance shock when $|\\text{Imb}_t|>0.6$).

Implement deterministic simulation of market/IOC orders with explicit and implicit costs (half‑spread crossing, slippage buckets, square‑root impact cost). Version run parameters (code commit hash, container digest, dataset snapshot hash, RNG seeds) to ensure deterministic replay.\n\nPortfolio allocator – Combine validated strategies into a portfolio subject to capacity, liquidity and risk gates (§6).

The architecture must be point‑in‑time (PIT) with no look‑ahead; all features at decision time must use only data available at time $t_0$; labels use data after $t_0$ but are never leaked into features. Components include:\n\nIngestion/Canonicalization – Collect raw trade, order book and funding data from multiple venues (CEX mandatory; DEX optional). Canonicalize into a time‑sorted event stream with uniform identifiers and time stamps (e.g., UTC timestamps truncated/rounded to the exchange’s minimum latency).

Funding‑related features (premium index, mark‑index deviation, etc.) rely on canonical definitions (§2). Derive microstructure features such as spreads, depth, volume buckets, realized volatility, liquidation count, OI changes, etc.\n\nEvent registry – A versioned database that defines event types (funding dislocation, basis dislocation, liquidation cascade, volatility shock, liquidity shock, structural break, regime shift, microstructure imbalance shock). Each event type has deterministic triggers expressed as functions of PIT features (e.g., funding dislocation when premium index + interest exceeds a threshold; order‑book imbalance shock when $|\\text{Imb}_t|>0.6$).

The labeling uses data strictly after $t_0$.\n\nValidation/backtesting engine – Evaluate candidate strategies under realistic execution and capacity constraints (§4). Use purged and embargoed cross‑validation to avoid look‑ahead and overlapping horizons. Implement deterministic simulation of market/IOC orders with explicit and implicit costs (half‑spread crossing, slippage buckets, square‑root impact cost). Version run parameters (code commit hash, container digest, dataset snapshot hash, RNG seeds) to ensure deterministic replay.\n\nPortfolio allocator – Combine validated strategies into a portfolio subject to capacity, liquidity and risk gates (§6).
